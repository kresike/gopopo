Description: GO Postfix Policy server (program)
 gopopo is a policy server for the Postfix mailer written in GO.
 .
 It does very simple rate limiting of emails based on sasl username or
 sender address where sasl is not available.  Rate limiting is done using
 in memory data, persistence is not implemented (yet?).
 .
 The algorithm used is a simple sliding window, the granularity is 1
 minute and the window length can be set using the configuration file,
 as ell as the default limit for one sender.
 .
 Exceptions can be set in the whitelist file in the form of a postfix
 map file, which has two columns. In the first column a user, domain or
 a sender can be specified, the second column should contain OK, but it
 is not used at the moment.
 .
 If you have domains that need different limits these can be specified
 in the same manner as the whitelist, with the exception that the first
 column can only contain domains.  The second column in this file contains
 the rate limit for that domain.
 .
 These map files do not support comments at this time.
 .
 Configuring the postfix mail server is very simple and can be done in
 two different ways.  The first one is by specifying the policy server
 in the smtpd_recipient_restrictions directive, like this:
 .
 smtpd_recipient_restrictions=check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:27091
 .
 This will have the effect of counting every email as 1 message because
 the postfix server does not know how many recipients the email message
 has at this stage.
 .
 The second and recommended way is to specify the policy server in the
 smtpd_data_restrictions directive, like this:
 .
 smtpd_data_restrictions=check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:27091
 .
 This will count the emails by looking at the recipients, and counting
 every recipient.  This is recommended, because it prevents users from
 abusing the server by sending emails to multiple recipients.
